// This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
// and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
// the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
//= require_self
//

// Here's where we define some default constants
//@import partials/base

// Then we'll import the compass extension
//@import h5bp

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except print and helpers) by uncommeting this line
//+h5bp-normalize

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
//@import partials/fonts
//@import partials/page

// Helpers classes should come second-to-last
//+h5bp-helpers

// Media should come last
//@import partials/media
